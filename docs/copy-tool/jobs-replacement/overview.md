Note that changes are only applied locally, it means if you change job link or job type, it will not actually be changed on your map.<br>
Online options seem to be useless now, since you cannot enter online mode without BE.

It's like an alternative way to copy jobs, but only from pc.

By double-clicking on the job link field, you can paste a new one, then you can load this job in the creator.

You can also change job type by double-clicking on it. For example, if you change type from capture to race, job will be loaded in the race creator, instead of the capture creator.
