Position should correspond to the exact location of the prop that you want to remove.

There's also a sphere type, you need to check 'Custom hide radius' checkbox and set a value like 50.<br>
All props that match prop name of the removed fixture will disappear inside the sphere.<br>
With this type, you don't need to know exact location of the prop.

Some props cannot be selected with fixture remover tool in the game, so you have to look them up in the CodeWalker, for example.
Also some props may have separate hitbox that also needs to be removed, it's prop name could also be found in the CodeWalker.
