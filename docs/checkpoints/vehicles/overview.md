Location tips: 

- 'SET' button sets cursor position to the appropriate position fields.
- Locations support arrow control(it depends on world/local alignment), more on [Arrow Control](/tips/arrow-control) page.

Save/restore works differently here, 'Save relative position' saves only offsets between vehicles, so you can restore them on the other map.
Start point coordinates are used as reference on restore, so by modifying start point position/heading you can adjust direction of grid vehicles on restore.

Grid vehicles position presets info is available on the [Grid Vehicles Presets](/checkpoints/vehicles/presets) page.

There's a list of all available transform vehicles, you can change vehicle in selected slot by double clicking on vehicle name from the list.
