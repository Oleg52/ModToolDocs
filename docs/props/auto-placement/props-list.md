If 'Randomize order' checkbox is disabled, props will be placed in order then are typed, otherwise order will be randomized.

By default, props from Props list are placed one time, but if you set Max props to use and check 'Max props as limit', props will be placed until max limit is reached:

You can combine options like rotation, steps, multipliers and get results like this:

Build line option:

If you want to build a straigth line with one prop and use both length and height step simultaneously, there's a Build line option.

**Note:** for this build type set Reference rotation Z coordinate to 0.

Some props like flat stunt track are rotated by 90 by default, so to fix line building put 90 in the Reference rotation Z coordinate:

If you want to flip prop upside down, type 180 in the Reference rotation Y coordinate field.
